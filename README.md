The purpose of the timer function is to initialize the timer and drive the state machine. Within this context, the period simply means the duration of one full cycle of the timer. It is the time taken for the timer to count from the minimum or initial value to its maximum value. Then, resets to the initial value. The Timer_CONTINUOUS_CALLBACK parameter impacted the driver such that it determines how the timerâ€™s callback function will be handled. This typically is. Associated with configuring a timer to continuously trigger a callback function at regular intervals.The gpioButtonFxn0() or the general-Purpose Input/Output is used with a button that is defined by the user or a callback function associated with a GPIO interrupt triggered by a button press. The purpose of GPIO_CFG_IN_INT_FALLING is used to configure a GPIO pin and set it to trigger an interrupt on the falling edge of the input signal. This is extremely essential for detecting button presses.

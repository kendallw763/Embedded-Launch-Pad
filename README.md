# Embedded-Launch-Pad

This project was to simply allow to LED lights on the mother blink by editing the code via Objective C programming. What I did well was alalyze and interpret the codebase and getting the code to run. As as an engineer, I think I could improve in the area of setting up projects quicker. After working on a project using Code Composure Studio. I will revisit the project and the code will not run because there are certain files that "already exist". I was able to rectify this by deleting the IDE and re downloading it. 

The tool associated with this build was Code Compsoure Studio and the libraries that automatically download into the prgram after hitting "build all." Furthermore, I used school and acredited resources to help me complete this. 

The skill from this project I have gained that are transferable are debugging, managing dependencies, and Turning in the work on time with very little to no errors. I made this project maintainable by following the instructions laied out by my instructor. The project is readable because the code base has been documented with comments.
